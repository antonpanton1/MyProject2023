	"oT3": "3. Afterward, up to 3 questions will be presented where each player has the opportunity to create up to 3 questions each. Every question must have an answer of a natural number between 0 and 100 (0 and 100 are included).",
	"oT4": "4. For a fair game, it is recommended that all players create an equal number of questions.",
	"oT5": "5. After this, you, as the host, are responsible for sharing the game code with your friends so they can join your game.",

	"tT1": "1. The game proceeds with all players' questions presented in turn.",
	"tT2": "2. The questions have an answer between 0 and 100 and you have to pick your answer before the host moves on. The game rewards close guesses so even if you don’t know the answer, take a good guess and you might not be too far off.",
	"tT3": "3. Pick your answer by dragging the slider or clicking on the plus or minus button. You can also enter your answer manually by clicking on the numbers.",
	"tT4": "4. After all players have guessed or the host decides to go on with the game, the correct answer is revealed.",
	"tT5": "5. A leaderboard is shown for all players. Your score is based on the difference between your guess and the answer. For example if you choose 10 and the answer was 56 your score will be 46. If you instead guessed the correct answer you will get -10 points for that question.",
	"tT6": "6. This is repeated until all questions have been raised and answerd. The player with the least points at the end wins the game!"
