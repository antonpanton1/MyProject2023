	"tT3": "3. Pick your answer by dragging the slider or clicking on the plus or minus button. You can also enter your answer manually by clicking on the numbers.",

	"tT5": "5. A leaderboard is shown for all players. Your score is based on the difference between your guess and the answer. For example if you choose 10 and the answer was 56 your score will be 46. If you instead guessed the correct answer you will get -10 points for that question.",
	"tT6": "6. This is repeated until all questions have been raised and answerd. The player with the least points at the end wins the game!"
